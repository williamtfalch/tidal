# Tidal home assignment

## Implementations
I added two implementations, one using a hoc-ish system, aptly named hocish. The other utilizes the modern approach of rtk query with all its benefits.

## Stuff I would do
- Responsive design
- Universal design
- Use color theme for color management
- Error handling
- Handle pagination where res includes more than 5 results with regard to artist search and album list
- Responsive css
