# Tidal home assignment

## To run

1) npm install
2) npm run dev

## Implementations
I added two implementations, one using a hoc-ish system, aptly named hocish. The other utilizes the modern approach of rtk query with all its benefits.

## Stuff I would do
- Responsive design
- Universal design
- Use color theme for color management
- Error handling
- Handle pagination where res includes more than 5 results with regard to artist search and album list
- Responsive css

## If errors
- Most likely: I used a proxy for development. Go to this link and request access: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/
- Less likely: You are getting a 429 in the console. I guess you'll have to wait for the quota to refresh.
